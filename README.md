# Retrode2 Virtual Boy Plugin
Virtual Boy plugin for the Retrode 2. Support RAM/ROM acces. Should be working with Hyper Fighting

Based on JonY and Skaman works. I've added a 74HC4053D and a switch to make it work with Hyper Fighting. It's working with classic VB Games (Rom/Save game) but unfortunately I can't test it with Hyper Fighting (because game was a limited run and is freaking expensive.

You'll find in the depository:
- The PCB (Eagle File and Gerber Files in a .ZIP) - Yes you need to print the small part on the top.
- The STL file of the cart sled.
- The PSD file for the label. Work well with decal paper

You'll need to assemble it:
- a 74HC4053D in SOIC
- a switch
- a right angle 1.7mm spacing row male header. You have 2x60pins to populate.
- an empty genesis cart shell.
